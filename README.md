# üßê Project philosophy

> The Accolades application is a digital token board used to assist people with neurodiversities. Token boards are used to teach and generalize appropriate behaviors we want children to exhibit. Visual aides like token boards and visual schedules are important and extremely useful for people with Autism. Accolades allows users to create a visual schedule and choose from various tokens to show progression through task completion. Once all the tasks are completed, the user is now rewarded with the choosen goal.
> 
> The user can choose up to 4 tasks and 1 goal to work towards. There are also fun tokens to choose from to encourage progression through the tasks.
